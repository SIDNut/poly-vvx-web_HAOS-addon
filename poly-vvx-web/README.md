# Home Assistant Add-on: Poly VVX web service

This add-on exposes a list of user defined home assistant sensor states in a simple HTML table for Poly (Polycom) VVX phones to display using their microbrowser.
The sensor states are updated every 30 seconds using an ajax call.

This add-on has only been tested on a Polycom VVX 500.
